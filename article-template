## Statistical analysis
Categorical variables are presented as absolute numbers and percentages and continuous variables as means with 95% binomial confidence intervals. Non-normally distributed data are presented as medians with 25-75% interquartile ranges (IQR). Distribution of variables are insepected by univariate assessment, and when in doubt, supplemented with Q-Q-plots. Categorical data was compared with Kruskal-Wallis tests, normally distributed data with Student's T-test, and non-normally distributed data with Wilcoxon Cox rank test. A two-sided value below 0.05 was interpreted as statistical significance.

# Results
`r nrow(df)` patients were included in this study. Mean age was `r ci.mean(df$age)` and `r nrow(df[sex == 1]` (`r format(100*nrow(df[sex == 1]/nrow(df), nsmall = 2, digits =3 )`) were male.
