# This function creates a Bland Altman plot with 95% confidence intervals (marked with dashed, red lines and a gray box, using ggplot2. All that is needed to specify is two variables, the rest is automatically calculated and the output is a ggplot2-object, which can be modifired afterwards as a normal ggplot2-object as shown below.
