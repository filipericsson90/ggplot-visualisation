# This function creates a Bland Altman plot with 95% confidence intervals, using ggplot2. All that is needed to specify is two variables, the rest is automatically calculated and the output is a ggplot2-object, which can be modifired afterwards as a normal ggplot2-object, eg.

# blandme(var1, var2) + labs(x = "Lollercopter", y = "Forskel", title = "Example of a title")

blandme <- function(var1, var2) {
  df$avg <- ((var1+var2)/2)
  df$difference <- var1-var2
  
  ggplot(data = df, aes(x = avg, y = difference)) + 
    geom_jitter() + 
    geom_hline(yintercept = mean(mean(df$difference)),  color = "steelblue4", size =1) + 
    geom_hline(yintercept = mean(df$difference) - (1.96 * sd(df$difference)), color = "dark red", size = 1, linetype = "dashed") + 
    geom_hline(yintercept = mean(df$difference) + (1.96 * sd(df$difference)), color = "dark red", size = 1, linetype = "dashed") +
    theme_bw() + 
    theme(text = element_text(family = "Times New Roman", size = 14), axis.title = element_text(face = "bold")) + 
    labs(
      title = "Bland Altman Plot of the means of difference",
      x = "BA Average",
      y = "Difference"
    )
}
